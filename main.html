             <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
            <p>
                Java is one of the most popular programming language, created in 1995. It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java. It is used to develop mobile application, desktop application, web application, games, database connections, and much more.
            </p>
             <p>
                Java works on different platforms. It is easy to learn and simple to use. Java is an obhect oriented language which gives a clear structure too programs and allows code to be reused. Some of the other programming languages like Java are Python, C++, JavaScript, R, Swift, etc.

            <h3><a href="/forloop/index.html">How-to-write a Java program using for loops</a></h3>
            <p>
               Loops are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied. In Java we have three types of basic loops: for, while and do-while. In this topic we will learn how to code with for loops. In for loop, initialization happens first and only one time, which means that the initialization part of for loop only executes once.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="/whileloop/index.html">How-to-write a Java program using while loops</a></h3>
            <p>
              In while loop, condition is evaluated first and if it returns true then the statements inside while loop execute. When condition returns false, the control comes out of loop and jumps to the next statement after while loop.
            </p>
            <h3><a href="/arrays/index.html">How-to-write a Java program using arrays</a></h3>
            <p>
                An array is a collection of similar types of data.In Java, we can initialize arrays during declaration. We can access the element of an array using the index number. Click on the topic to learn about Java using array in details.

            <h3><a href="/switchcase/index.html">How-to-write a Java program using switch case statements</a></h3>
            <p>
                Switch case statement is used when we have number of options (or choices) and we may need to perform a different task for each choice.Switch Case statement is mostly used with break statement even though it is optional. We will first see an example without break statement and then we will discuss switch case with break. CLick
